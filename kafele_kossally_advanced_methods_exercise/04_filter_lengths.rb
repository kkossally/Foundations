# Write a method, filter_lengths(strings, length), that accepts an array of strings
# and a length as args. The method should return an array containing the strings
# that have at least the given length. The length argument should be optional; if no length
# is passed in, then 5 should be used as the length.

def filter_lengths(strings, length=5)
    filtered_strings = [] # create array to collect filtered strings
    strings.each { |string| filtered_strings << string if string.length >= length } # iterate through strings, shovel if string is >= length
    filtered_strings
